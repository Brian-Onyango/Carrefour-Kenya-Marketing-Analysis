## Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing your dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights gained from your analysis.

## Part 2: Feature Selection
This section requires you to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods learned earlier this week. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.
## Part 3: Association Rules
This section will require that you create association rules that will allow you to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. You are provided with a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. Just like in the other sections, you will also be required to provide insights for your analysis.
